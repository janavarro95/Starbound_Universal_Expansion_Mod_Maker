Possible FAQ:
-----------------------------------------
Q: What code is this written in?
A: C# using Unity's mono develop.

Q: Do you plan on implementing (insert feature here)?
A: The most simple answer is possibly. It really depeneds on how busy I am, but I do want to add as much support as possible

Q: Help my code didn't work!
A: Something might have been input wrong on your end. Starbound can be really picky on how the code is read.
  If unsure open up the Starbound assets folder and compare your code. You might have simply misplaced a comma or input a letter where a number should be. Also when working with decimals make sure the decimal has a 0 in front of it if less than 0.
  Starbound needs to read a 0 to ensure that is a number. I'm not sure why.
  
Q: When will you update this next?
A: Whenever I get a chance, but I plan on hopefully sticking to a weekly or atleast bi-weekly update schedual. It really depends on how busy I am. I want to ensure that the program stays up to date with Starbound though.
